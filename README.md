<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm felixoi</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a computer science student from germany who likes coding.</h3>

<p align="center">I started programming in Java when I was a young teenager</div>
<p align="center">Nowadays, I'm mostly doing web-based projects as hobby but I'm still using Java at the university.</p>
<p align="center">A lot knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript frameworks like VueJS I gained in various projects and contributions.</p>
<p align="center">Furthermore, I used other programming languages like Python or C# at work.</p>

<hr/>

The most of my contributions are currently going to the [SpongePowered](https://www.spongepowered.org) organization,   
where I help maintaining various web-projects like the the plugin reposity [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org).
