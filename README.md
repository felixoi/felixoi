<h1>About myself.</h1>
I welcome you to my profile page! However you came here, I appreciate your interest in my person.<br />
My name is <b>felixoi</b> or formerly known as <b>Felix</b> KleinekathÃ¶fer from Germany.<br />
If that's all you wanted to now, you can stop reading here. As you read on, you will learn something about my programming history.<br/><br/>
It all started with the popular video game Minecraft. I learned to program extensions, so-called mods, and thus extend the game. For this I learned to program in the Java programming language. Nowadays I have turned more to web technologies.<br/><br/>
The most of my contributions are currently going to the <a href="https://github.com/SpongePowered">SpongePowered</a> organization, where I help maintaining various web-projects like the the plugin repository <a href="https://github.com/SpongePowered/Ore">Ore</a>.<br/><br/>
If you have any questions about me or my work, go ahead and write to <a href="mailto:felix@felixoi.com">felix@felixoi.com</a>!
<br /><br />
Cheers, Felix ðŸ¥‚
